# RetroMania
## A barely functional Doom-style FPS made in high school. The doors work. That’s the highlight.

# What This Is
## RetroMania is a first-person shooter I built in high school as a final project. Think Doom, but stripped of polish, playtesting, and artistic direction. I spent three weeks learning Unity, then crammed the actual game together in a week. It earned a 19/20, probably because the doors open and close reliably.

# Features (Generously Speaking)
- Prototype textures straight from the “default” folder
- Enemies that technically move
- Guns that fire... something
- Levels that exist
- Doors that work 100% of the time (unironically)

# Dev notes
- No real AI – just enough logic to look like they might attack
- No UI polish – expect raw text and placeholder everything
- Sound? Probably. Don’t expect much.
- Codebase held together with if statements and hope
  
# How to play
- Launch the game
- Walk around (WASD)
- Click to shoot things that may or may not respond
- Use doors. They’re great.
- That’s it.

# Why it exists
A school assignment + too much time on YouTube tutorials = this. No regrets—learned a lot, got a good grade, and the doors still haunt my memory.
